                    <h2>The Basics</h2>
                    <p id='basics-first-para'><i>Space Mountain</i> is a thrilling indoor roller coaster located at Disney theme parks 
                        that takes riders on an exhilarating journey through outer space. Unlike traditional 
                        roller coasters, it's set in complete darkness with a space-themed ambiance, creating 
                        a unique and immersive experience.</p>
                    <p>Riders sit in small space-ship style cars as they twist, 
                        turn, and drop through a cosmic landscape filled with stars, planets, and aestroids, 
                        all while feeling like they're soaring through the stars thanks to the simulated 
                        space adventure.</p>
                    <p>Ever since the original version's opening in 1975, it's been a popular 
                        attraction known for its combination of thrilling coaster elements and otherworldly theme. 
                        Ever since then, Space Mountain has been built in new parks across the world, allowing 
                        people from all over the world to experience their own thrilling space adventure.</p>
