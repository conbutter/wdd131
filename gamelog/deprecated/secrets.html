                <p>Space Mountain is hiding far more secrets and tricks under its glossy white roof. From references 
                    to other projects that Disney has made, to practical effects, to even more- this ride has built 
                    up quite a lot of secrets since it's original opening in 1975, so why don't we explore exactly 
                    what's hiding there?</p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Space Mountain at WDW is the only two-track Space Mountain in existence.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para-img'>When Disneyland's version of Space Mountain was under development, there wasn't enough space to replicate the entire version from  
                            Disney World, so the two-track design was dropped in favor of an entirely new one-track coaster that used the entire 
                            space of the smaller mountain structure.<br><br>As time went on and Space Mountain was built at even more 
                            Disney resorts, the choice was made to replicate the Disneyland version or create an entirely new coaster design. 
                            As a result, the Space Mountain guests experience at WDW is a fundamentally different coaster from every 
                            other iteration of the ride, despite sharing the same name and theme.<br><br>Even with these differences, that makes Space Mountain at Walt Disney World still a unique coaster to ride today, nearly 50 years after opening!</p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Space Mountain lies to you about its real intensity.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para'>Space Mountain is a ride that can be enjoyed by families and has a very short height requirement, and as a result, the 
                            coaster was designed with a variety of practical effects to make it appear far more intense and immersive than it actually is. Despite the top speed of a mere 27 
                            miles per hour, the coaster uses fans and air-cannons pointed at riders to make it feel like guests are moving far faster than they actually are. 
                            Disco balls are placed at strategic points throughout the attraction with lights projected at them to create the starfield effects, and the major darkness 
                            of the attraction makes each drop and turn seem far more intense. When you're riding a rollercoaster where you can see the track, you're able to mentally brace 
                            for the movement of the ride- but, because Space Mountain is mostly enclosed in the dark despite certain effects, you can't rely on your sight for what the coaster will do next, 
                            meaning each turn and drop feels far more sudden and intense as a result.</p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Shanghai Disneyland is the ONLY Disney resort around the world without a Space Mountain.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para'>When Disney was designing the most recent Disney resort, 
                            the Shanghai Disneyland resort, they made an agreement with the Chinese government about the park's design. That agreement allegedly included the
                            clause that the park would feature new attractions exclusive only to Shanghai. As a result, Space Mountain, which had existed
                            at many Disney parks before, was passed up in favor of a new coaster themed to TRON to serve as the park's flagship thrill ride.
                            The final ride, named 'TRON Lightcycle Power Run', ended up including some inspirations and designs from the original Space Mountain design;
                            specifically, it features a coaster track that flows inside and outside of the main ride building.</p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Space Mountain at Disneyland Paris was the first version of the ride to feature synchronized audio.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para-img'>When imagineers were developing the version of the coaster to debut at Disneyland Paris (also titled 'Space Mountain: De La Terra a La Lune), 
                            they wanted to go all out- and part of that included featuring on-board music, known as a SOBAT (Synchronized On-Board Audio Track). SOBATs 
                            were unique in that they were able to time audio to the position of the car, meaning that the entire track could be scored. 
                            <br><br>SOBATs would eventually be added into other versions of Space Mountain, specifically the Disneyland and  
                            Hong Kong Disneyland versions respectively. The songs that play in the original Paris version was written by Steve Bramson, 
                            while the California and Hong Kong versions were written by Michael Giacchino.<br><br>While Space Mountain at Walt Disney World doesn't include the 
                            SOBAT technology, it does have a soundtrack that plays during the ride- only, the speakers are fixed in the coaster structure itself, rather than being connected to the 
                            ride vehicles.<br><br></p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Space Mountain featured two seasonal Halloween versions.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para'>In 2007, Hong Kong Disneyland would introduce a new version 
                            of the attraction for their park's Halloween festivities, titled 'Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy'. Not only would this new version 
                            feature a brand new on-ride soundtrack with a more sinister tone, but it would introduce projection mapping effects and adjusted 
                            practical effects to give the illusion of riders being chased by a spectral being while flying through space. The seasonal retheme 
                            would end up becoming so popular that it would be cloned to the Disneyland version of the coaster in California for the 2009 season, 
                            and this tradition continued until 2018. However, Ghost Galaxy wasn't the first overlay to be created for the Disneyland Space mountain- 
                            that title belongs to a different overlay named 'Space Mountain: Nightmare Nebula' from 2007; however, despite the sick sounding name, the overlay 
                            was not much more to it than that. Unlike the elaborate retheming of Ghost Galaxy, Nightmare Nebula consisted of turning the ride's effects off (resulting 
                            in a pitch-black ride experience) and some simple decorations. After the understandably poor reception it recieved, the overlay never returned and 
                            it would eventually be avenged by Ghost Galaxy's introduction to the park in 2009.</p>

                        <h2 class='secrets-card-title'>Space Mountain's track at Disneyland had to be completely rebuilt in 2003.</h2>
                        <p class='secrets-card-para'>During a routine check on the attraction in early 2003, 
                            the inspectors found the track to be dangerously unstable. As a result, the ride closed suddenly on April 10, 2003, with 
                            an announcement that it would remain closed until Disneyland's 50th anniversary. 
                            After assessing the situation, the inspectors determined the ride would need a complete track replacement. On July 15, 2005, 
                            just a few days before Disneyland's 50th Anniversary celebration, Space Mountain would finally reopen. The 
                            new version of the ride featured new rocket sleds, brand new special effects and a revised storyline. 
                            The new track would end up being exactly the same layout as originally designed; however, some adjustments 
                            had been made to the foundation of the building and the evacuation procedures, to make the ride much safer. 
                            Since Arrow Dynamics had gone out of buisness many years before the incident, the new track was manufactured by 
                            Dynamic Structures.</p>
