      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The website will be about the history and the secrets of the classic theme park attractions under the name of “Space Mountain”, many of which exist across the world at various Disney theme parks and resorts. Essentially, it's like if a pamphlet on the history of Space Mountain was designed as a website. Visitors will be able to read brief histories of the attractions, view images and embedded videos of the attractions, as well as how the rides operate and the technical elements and specifications that make each iteration unique.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience includes fans and enthusiasts of theme parks- particularly those interested in attraction history and design. However, the content should be created and written in such a way that it can be easily digestible by those who are not familiar with specific lingo and terms that only exist in the theme park community. The content should be tailored towards an audience that is interested in learning more about the history and background of the attraction who doesn't want to spend too much time learning about it, as well as act as a refresher for those already familiar with the attraction.

        Welcome to <b>StarPort Archive</b>, the galaxy's number-one spot for everything Space Mountain.
        Ever since 1975, Space Mountain has been delighting and surprising guests, providing them with a
        thrilling adventure through the cosmos unlike anything else ever created- and now, you can learn
        about exactly how this ground-breaking attraction came to be!

        -> THE BASICS:
        Space Mountain is a thrilling indoor roller coaster located at Disney theme parks
        that takes riders on an exhilarating journey through outer space. Unlike traditional
        roller coasters, it's set in complete darkness with a space-themed ambiance, creating
        a unique and immersive experience. Riders sit in small space-ship style cars as they twist, 
        turn, and drop through a cosmic landscape filled with stars, planets, and aestroids,
        all while feeling like they're soaring through the stars thanks to the simulated 
        space adventure. Ever since the original version's opening in 1975, it's been a popular
        attraction known for its combination of thrilling coaster elements and otherworldly theme.
        Ever since then, Space Mountain has been built in new parks across the world, allowing
        people from all over the world to experience their own thrilling space adventure.

      <h3>History & Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        The concept for Space Mountain, one of Disney's most iconic attractions,
        can traced back to the 1950s and Walt Disney's interest in space exploration.
        He was captivated by the Space Age and the emerging interest in space travel
        during that era, and after the opening of the Matterhorn Bobsleds at his California
        Disneyland park, Walt knew coasters had a place at his park. This fascination with space
        led to the idea of a space-themed  roller coaster- one that wouldn't be very different
        from the Space Mountain we know of today. However, Walt wouldn't get to realize
        this concept in his lifetime, but after Disney World opened in 1971, his Imagineers
        knew how to move forward.

        In order to design the coaster, the Imagineers partnered with Arrow Dynamics- a 
        popular and well-experienced coaster manufacturer. The design and development of Space
        Mountain were complex and ambitious. Originally, Space Mountain consisted of four seperate
        coasters in one white, glossy mountain-shaped style building, with coaster track flowing
        in and outside of the structure- but it would eventually be resized to contain just two 
        mirrored tracks, placed side-by-side to each other, allowing for two different experiences
        in the same coaster. The exterior of the building itself was designed to resemble a
        futuristic spaceport, enhancing the immersive experience. The coaster was
        also innovative in that it featured a tubular steel track, a relatively
        new technology at the time, which allowed for smoother
        and more dynamic ride experiences. Not only that, but Space Mountain would become
        first theme park attraction to entirely be operated by a computer- allowing for easier
        and smoother operations. RCA, the electronics company, would sponsor the attraction and put up
        half of the necessary $20 million needed to construct it.

        Construction of Space Mountain presented its own unique challenges. Building an
        indoor coaster within the constraints of the theme park was a monumental task.
        The massive dome-shaped structure was constructed, which would house the coaster
        and create a sense of traveling through the cosmos. The coaster's track was
        carefully laid out inside the building, which featured special lighting effects
        to create the illusion of stars and other celestial elements. The ride's complex
        infrastructure and layout made it a true engineering marvel.

        Eventually, the ride was finished and was ready for the public. 
        The first Space Mountain opened at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom
        in Orlando, Florida, on January 15, 1975. The attraction's official opening was a grand
        event, and thousands of guests would flock to the park and the ride to experience it
        for themselves. It quickly became one of the most popular rides at Walt Disney World.
        Visitors were awed by the combination of thrilling twists and turns, the darkness that added an
        element of mystery, and the exciting sensation of hurtling through space. Space Mountain
        was an immediate success and set a new standard for theme park attractions. Its
        innovative design and immersive experience inspired many other theme parks to
        create their own indoor roller coasters and push the boundaries of theme park technology. 
        It was a major milestone for Disney and the theme park industry as a whole. 

        Ever since 1975, Space Mountain has been delighting and thrilling guests at
        the Magic Kingdom. It wouldn't be long, however, until it would start to appear
        with various iterations in Disneyland and other Disney resorts across the globe.
        
        The attraction has seen it's fair share of changes and updates since 1975;
        updated and enhanced technology as well as special effects would occupy the mountain
        over the years, but the core ride experience and concept remains the same to this day.
        Space Mountain remains an enduring symbol of Walt Disney's vision for immersive, innovative,
        and inspiring theme park experiences. It continues to captivate visitors of all ages
        and remains a shining example of Disney's dedication to storytelling and creativity
        in the world of theme parks.

      <h3>Secrets & Trivia</h3>
      <p>
        Space Mountain is hiding far more secrets and tricks under its glossy white roof. From references 
        to other projects that Disney has made, to practical effects, to even more- this ride has built 
        up quite a lot of secrets since it's original opening in 1975, so why don't we explore exactly 
        what's hiding there?

        -> SECRET: Space Mountain in WDW is the only two-track Space Mountain in existence. When Disneyland's  
        version of Space Mountain was under development, there wasn't enough space to replicate the entire version from  
        Disney World, so the two-track design was dropped in favor of an entirely new one-track coaster that used the entire 
        space of the smaller mountain structure. As time went on and Space Mountain was built at even more 
        Disney resorts, the choice was made to replicate the Disneyland version or create an entirely new coaster design. 
        As a result, the Space Mountain guests experience at WDW is a fundamentally different coaster from every 
        other iteration of the ride, despite sharing the same name and theme.

        -> SECRET: Space Mountain at Disneyland Paris was the first version of the ride to feature synchronized audio. 
        When imagineers were developing the version of the coaster to debut at Disneyland Paris (also titled 'Space Mountain: De La Terra a La Lune), 
        they wanted to go all out- and part of that included featuring on-board music, known as a SOBAT (Synchronized On-Board Audio Track). SOBATs 
        were unique in that they were able to time audio to the position of the car, meaning that the entire track could be scored. 
        SOBATs would eventually be added into other versions of Space Mountain, specifically the Disneyland and  
        Hong Kong Disneyland versions respectively. The songs that play in the original Paris version was written by Steve Bramson, 
        while the California and Hong Kong versions were written by Michael Giacchino.

        -> SECRET: Space Mountain's track at Disneyland had to be completely rebuilt in 2003. During a routine check on the attraction in early 2003, 
        the inspectors found the track to be dangerously unstable. As a result, the ride closed suddenly on April 10, 2003, with 
        an announcement that it would remain closed until Disneyland's 50th anniversary. 
        After assessing the situation, the inspectors determined the ride would need a complete track replacement. On July 15, 2005, 
        just a few days before Disneyland's 50th Anniversary celebration, Space Mountain would finally reopen. The 
        new version of the ride featured new rocket sleds, brand new special effects and a revised storyline. 
        The new track would end up being exactly the same layout as originally designed; however, some adjustments 
        had been made to the foundation of the building and the evacuation procedures, to make the ride much safer. 
        Since Arrow Dynamics had gone out of buisness many years before the incident, the new track was manufactured by 
        Dynamic Structures.

        -> SECRET: Space Mountain featured two seasonal Halloween overlays. In 2007, Hong Kong Disneyland would introduce a new version 
        of the attraction for their park's Halloween festivities, titled 'Space Mountain: Ghost Galaxy'. Not only would this new version 
        feature a brand new on-ride soundtrack with a more sinister tone, but it would introduce projection mapping effects and adjusted 
        practical effects to give the illusion of riders being chased by a spectral being while flying through space. The seasonal retheme 
        would end up becoming so popular that it would be cloned to the Disneyland version of the coaster in California for the 2009 season, 
        and this tradition continued until 2018. However, Ghost Galaxy wasn't the first overlay to be created for the Disneyland Space mountain- 
        that title belongs to a different overlay named 'Space Mountain: Nightmare Nebula' from 2007; however, despite the sick sounding name, the overlay 
        was not much more to it than that. Unlike the elaborate retheming of Ghost Galaxy, Nightmare Nebula consisted of turning the ride's effects off (resulting 
        in a pitch-black ride experience) and some simple decorations. After the understandably poor reception it recieved, the overlay never returned and 
        it would eventually be avenged by Ghost Galaxy's introduction to the park in 2009.

        -> SECRET: Space Mountain lies to you about its real intensity. Space Mountain is a ride that can be enjoyed by families and has a very short height requirement, and as a result, the 
        coaster was designed with a variety of practical effects to make it appear far more intense and immersive than it actually is. Despite the top speed of a mere 27 
        miles per hour, the coaster uses fans and air-cannons pointed at riders to make it feel like guests are moving far faster than they actually are. 
        Disco balls are placed at strategic points throughout the attraction with lights projected at them to create the starfield effects, and the major darkness 
        of the attraction makes each drop and turn seem far more intense. When you're riding a rollercoaster where you can see the track, you're able to mentally brace 
        for the movement of the ride- but, because Space Mountain is mostly enclosed in the dark despite certain effects, you can't rely on your sight for what the coaster will do next, 
        meaning each turn and drop feels far more sudden and intense as a result.

        -> SECRET: Shanghai Disneyland is the ONLY Disney resort around the world without a Space Mountain. When Disney was designing the most recent Disney resort, 
        the Shanghai Disneyland resort, they made an agreement with the Chinese government about the park's design. That agreement allegedly included the
        clause that the park would feature new attractions exclusive only to Shanghai. As a result, Space Mountain, which had existed
        at many Disney parks before, was passed up in favor of a new coaster themed to TRON to serve as the park's flagship thrill ride.
        The final ride, named 'TRON Lightcycle Power Run', ended up including some inspirations and designs from the original Space Mountain design;
        specifically, it features a coaster track that flows inside and outside of the main ride building.

        There are plenty more secrets and easter eggs to be found within all versions of the iconic ride all across the world. The next time you visit, whatever
        StarPort you do visit, be sure to keep an eye out during your adventure!
