			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>GameLog is a website that will allow users to keep track of the games they own and view them based on specific criteria. They will be able to
                select platforms, completion status, input total hours played, along with other features, and sort them based on such criteria.
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>GameLog will primarily be designed for people who are into the hobby of gaming, and typically play a lot of games on
                a variety of platforms. The website will be designed for people who are somewhat competent in the structure and information
                regarding games, but should not be complicated to use or understand. Typical expected age range would be users from age 15-30,
                with gamers from both genders considered in the design.
            </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Games added by users will be added to an object and displayed on the site via JavaScript. They will also be able to view overall completion statistics
                and sort their games based on platform, completion status, and favorites, or track their total amount of hours in each game. Users can also view how much time
                they've played all of their games in total. Both pages will also have a dark mode functionality, allowing users to make the page more
				appealing to use depending on their preference.
                </p>
