                    <p id='basics-first-para'><i>GameLog</i> GameLog is a brand new service that allows you to record and log 
                        all of the games you play,including specific details like platform, favorites, and playtime. With 
                        GameLog, it's easy to consolidate your entire game library from across a variety of platforms, 
                        consoles, and storefronts. Plus, it's free to use forever!</p>
                    <h2>Conquer Your Backlog</h2>
                    <p>For collectors who play games across a variety of platforms and systems, it can often be difficult
                        to keep track of what games you own, which ones you've played, and which ones you want to play.
                        GameLog makes things simple by helping you to sort and outline your library. No longer do you need
                        to 
                    </p>
                    <h2>How to Use GameLog</h2>
                    <p>Get started by adding a game to your log by pressing the [+] button, and fill in the information that 
                        is relevant to you. Then, click "Add" to add it to your library! You can also edit content of any 
                        game you've added by pressing the Pencil icon, or remove them entirely by pressing [-]. Feel free 
                        to filter and search your library too by using the search bar at the top, which searches through 
                        your entire library for titles that match your query.</p>
