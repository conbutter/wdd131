/* So that attribution link at the bottom of our site is not the most attractive thing.
We can minimize the size (And you should. Try 0.6em), so it is less noticiable, but it
will still stick out. What if we don't want to attribute? That is easy...be willing to
pay to use the resources. All of these sites remove the attribution requirement if you
pay :) */
